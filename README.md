# DCA-Arps-Model
This project focuses on implementing Decline Curve Analysis (DCA) using the Arps empirical models â€” **exponential**, **harmonic**, and **hyperbolic** â€” to estimate production performance of oil and gas wells. The goal is to visualize and analyze production decline trends using synthetic data and regression fitting techniques.

## ðŸ“Š Features

- Accepts production data via CSV (Time vs Rate).
- Visualizes production decline using matplotlib.
- Fits the data to:
  - Exponential decline
  - Harmonic decline
  - Hyperbolic decline
